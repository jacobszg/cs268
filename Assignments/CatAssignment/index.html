        <p>Cats play an important role in the world around us. They provide a home for parasites like blood sucking fleas and the toxoplasmosis 
            causing <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. They keep our roads and highways stocked with carrion for native scavengers and the odd man from Kentucky. 
            They even provide our philosophers a scientific standard of indifference. </p>
        <p>However, there have been disconcerting rumblings in the taxonomic community that the general-public have been confusing the common 
            house cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) with its less agreeable I-will-rip-your-face-off cousin, the Ocelot (<i>Leopardus pardalis</i>).</p>
        <p>This scathing indictment of former President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” act has been aggressively addressed by the Minecraft community, 
            but the attempt has fallen short. </p>
        <p>Here you will begin a journey of self-enlightenment as you explore the differences between the common house cat, Ligers, and Ocelots. Make 
            sure to scroll lightly and take your time to associate these magnificent animals with unforgettable quotes from cornerstone individuals of 
            human civilization.</p>

                 independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master-class men."</i>
