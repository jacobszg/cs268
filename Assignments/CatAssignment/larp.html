        <h2>Feline LARPing</h2>
        <p>In addition to being mistaken for Ocelots, cats are becoming aware of how they are perceived in some public circles 
                (such as the one the creator of this website runs in). To counteract such a negative view some cats have taken to 
                FLARPing (otherwise known as Feline LARPing, otherwise known as Cats Live Action Role Playing or CLARPing). </p>

        <p><i>"This Khajiit is cold..."</i></p>

        <br>
        <p>This has had a mixed reception with the general public as everyone knows how comfortable it is to be out numbered by individuals 
            dressed up in costume, speaking strangly, totting weapons (fake or otherwise), and taking action on imaginary things in a (very real) 
            public space.</p>
        <p>To help our fellow civilians better accecpt FLARPing as an acceptable pass time, have your cats or fellow cat owners who already participate 
            in FLARPing to consider the following tips.</p> 

        <h2>Tips to FLARPing</h2>
        <h3>Try Using Imaginary Weapons</h3>

        <p>Not only does this lower the stress of the passive observer, but also allows a larger budget for costumes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Play on Public Sentiment</h3>
        <hr>
        <img height="350" src="images/OregonTrail.jpg" title="Who needs DOS"/>
        <p>There are certain things that every one can relate to, try to incorporate these things into your FLARPing.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>It's a Lifestyle Choice</h3>
        <hr>
        <img height="350" src="images/LionKing.jpg" title="The Circle of Life!"/>
        <p>FLARPing is not for everyone. Please do not force your cat into any activities they would otherwise not participate in.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>We Warned You!</h3>
       <hr>
       <img height="350" src="images/Help.jpg" title="Help!"/>
       <p>There have been cases of humans forcing their cats into FLARPing. Some cats in these situations have lost touch with reality 
           and get fixated on particular roles that tend to have a rather, let's say, "Evil" alignment... Here are their stories.
