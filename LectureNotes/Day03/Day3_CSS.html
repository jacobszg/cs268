        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            What's the reason?
            <li>We want to present uniformity (if something looks like this and does this, be consistent)</li>
            <li>we can define looks with this (Browsers have a default looks... 12pt font, white background, timesNewRomans, and left aligned)</li>
            <li>get out of using attributes within the html elements</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Inline Styles</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>EXAMPLE: </p>
        <p>"style<br>
            selector {<br>
                property: value;<br>
                property: value;<br>
            }<br>
        /style>"<br>
        </p>
        <p>be aware of font familiy</p>
        <p>we use link (not links, or a)</p>
        <p>put the link in the head...</p>
        <h2>
            Style Location
        </h2>
        <p>3 types of locations... Google it...</p>
        <p>4 types of style selectors: Tag, Class, ID, Compounds</p>
        <p>proper descriptive naming is important</p>
        <p> define ID with a # (hashtag)</p>
        <p>I am trying to keep up in my notes but this is all going fast and furious , review D2L, just review D2L</p>
        <h2>Cascading Style</h2>
        <p>a single element may have styles of multiple types (tag, class, and ID) that apply to it</p>
        <p>if style conflicts arise, it will choose the most specific option (whats at the bottom of the cascade) its like tetris...</p>
        <h2>Compound Style selectors</h2>
        <p>be aware of nesting where you define things</p>
        <p>if you style your links be aware of the excisting context established in the user community</p>
        <p>don't destroy a good bridge and build a crappy one; in fact, don't even break a crappy bridge that they are used to driving on...</p>
