        <h1>DAY THREE</h1>
        <h2>CORRECTION:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> alt text is used in place of an image that cannot be accessed</p>
        <p>title text is used to augment image to usually provide text when mouse hovers over text</p>
        <h2>Relative Linking</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>ABSOLUTE: specifies a files location RELATIVE to the root location</p>
        <p>RELATIVE: speciefies a files location relative to current files location</p>
        <ul>
            things to note
            <li>->. current directory</li>
            <li>.. parent directory</li>
            <li>/ root</li>
            <li>(Unix ONLY) ~ home</li>
        </ul>
        <p>be sure you know how to navigate the directories you need to access</p>
        <p>example: "images/puppy.jpg" assumes "./images/puppy.jpg"</p>
        <p>"../../" will get you to the current parent directory's parent</p>
        <h2>Metaelements</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>example: </p>
        <meta name="description" content="Web site about...">
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
        <br>
        <p>I suppose you never saw that... because it's metaelements. you can review the vaious names of meta on Google</p>
        <p>More Examples...</p>
        <meta name="keywards" content="pets,dogs,cats">
        <br>
        <p>...O yeah, you still can't see that</p>
        <p>That was an example of keywords... Don't use that meta name UNLESS you are using it for an in-house search</p>
        <p>TAKE AWAY... Meta for robots will only be followed by polite robots... the terminator will still kill you...</p>
